 if the XOR of N bits is 0, then an even number of the N bits are set to 1. We can flip one bit to make the number of 1 bits odd, and then the result of the XOR will become 1. Similarly, if the XOR of N bits is 1, then an odd number of the N bits are set to 1. We can again flip one bit to make the number of 1 bits even, which will change the result of the XOR to 0.
 
 -> To get Answer : Count the different bits between XOR result of given num array and k.
